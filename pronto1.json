Detail Test Steps:]\r\nCall is started on 5G cell (ENDC B66-N41)\r\nCall is started on 4G cell (B41)\r\nLTE cell is locked (B41) CellID 44832 in logs  call is moved to the second LTE B41 Cell\r\nLTE Cell is unlocked \r\n\r\n[2. Expected Result:]\r\nAfter LTE cell(B41) CellID 44832 is unlocked, call on 5G(ENDC B66-N41) should not be impacted.\r\n\r\n[3. Actual Result:]\r\nAfter LTE cell(B41) is unlocked, on 5G(ENDC B66-N41) call is dropped for a few seconds and RACH Failure appears, and after several tries RACH Attempt is successful.\r\n\r\n[4. Tester analysis:]\r\nThe reason we decided to assign this PR directly to RF_RD_L1LOW_OU1 group  because the issue is fairly similar with an old PR626420 from 22R1 opened for CB008145 feature\r\nNow we are testing for feature CB007844 that is the follow up for CB008145 including more AEHC 2CC combos \r\n\r\nThe issue is observed after LTE cell is unlocked. The issue is seen on 50+80 2CC combo supported by CB008744.\r\n\r\nThe issue was not reproduced for lower 2CC combos like 20+30\r\n\r\nFrom the QXDM logs we can see the same 5G RACH failure after LTE cell unlock from webEM\r\nRach Reason = BEAM_FAILURE\r\n RACH Result = FAILURE_MSG2_RA_TIMER_EXP\r\n and then after one other or several attempts  RACH Result = SUCCESS\r\n \r\n12:05:33.614\t[0xB889]\tNR5G MAC RACH Trigger\r\nMacVersion {\r\n   Major.Minor = 2\r\n   1\r\n}\r\nVersion 131073 {\r\n   Log Fields Change BMask = 0\r\n   Header {\r\n      Num Records = 1\r\n   }\r\n   CRNTI = 19294\r\n   Rach Reason = BEAM_FAILURE\r\n   Carrier Id = 0\r\n   First Active UL BWP = 1\r\n   RACH Contention = PDCCH_CRNTI\r\n   RA Id = 0\r\n   MSG3 Size = 0\r\n   MSG3 = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }\r\n}\r\n\r\n12:05:33.672\t[0xB88A]\tNR5G MAC RACH Attempt\r\nMacVersion {\r\n   Major.Minor = 2\r\n   7\r\n}\r\nVersion 131079 {\r\n   Log Fields Change BMask = 0x0\r\n   Sub ID = 0\r\n   Header {\r\n      Num Records = 1\r\n   }\r\n   Num Attempt = 1\r\n   SSB ID = 0\r\n   CSI RS ID  = 0\r\n   Carrier ID = 0\r\n   RACH Result = FAILURE_MSG2_RA_TIMER_EXP\r\n   Contention Type = PDCCH_CRNTI\r\n   Contention Type Value = 3\r\n   RACH Msg Bitmask = 0x01\r\n   Msg1 SCS = 30 KHz\r\n   UL BWP SCS = 30KHZ\r\n   RACH Msg1 {\r\n      System Time {\r\n         Frame =    370\r\n         Sub Frame =      2\r\n         Slot =     1\r\n      }\r\n      Symbol Start =    0\r\n      Prach Config =    156\r\n      Preamble Format =  FORMAT_B4\r\n      RA Id =    56\r\n      FDM =          0\r\n      Uroot =            8\r\n      Cyclic Shift V =            0\r\n      RA RNTI =           71\r\n      RAR Window Start SFN {\r\n         Frame =    370\r\n         Sub Frame =      3\r\n         Slot =     0\r\n      }\r\n      RAR Window End SFN {\r\n         Frame =    374\r\n         Sub Frame =      3\r\n         Slot =     0\r\n      }\r\n      Backoff Duration =          0 usec\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n[5.
